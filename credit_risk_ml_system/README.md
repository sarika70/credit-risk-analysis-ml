Credit Risk Machine Learning System

This project implements an end-to-end credit scoring pipeline with professional monitoring and explainability.

Key Features

WOE Encoding Logic: Linearizes relationships between categories and default risk.

Credit Metrics: Tracks Gini Coefficient and KS-Statistic instead of just Accuracy.

Observability: Integrated with MLflow for experiment tracking and SHAP for local model explanations.

Maintenance: Includes PSI (Population Stability Index) calculation to detect data drift post-deployment.

Real-time: Flask API ready for deployment.

Directory Structure

main.py: The single entry point containing training, API, and monitoring logic.

artifacts/: Stores the serialized model and reference datasets for drift comparison.

mlruns/: Generated by MLflow to store parameters and metrics.

How to Run

Install requirements: pip install pandas scikit-learn mlflow flask shap joblib scipy

Run python main.py to train the model.

Uncomment app.run() in the bottom of main.py to start the inference server.
