# 💳 Credit Risk Analysis using Machine Learning

*A machine learning system to analyze customer credit data and predict creditworthiness.*

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **credit risk analysis** using **machine learning**.
The system evaluates customer financial and demographic data to determine whether a customer is **likely to repay a loan** or become a **credit risk**.

This helps financial institutions make **better, data-driven lending decisions**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze customer credit data
* Identify risk patterns
* Predict loan default probability
* Support automated loan approval systems

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Customer financial data is collected
2. Data is cleaned and preprocessed
3. Features such as income, age, loan amount, and credit history are analyzed
4. A machine learning model predicts whether the customer is **low-risk or high-risk**
5. The result is used to support credit approval decisions
