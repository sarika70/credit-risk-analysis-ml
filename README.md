#  Credit Risk Prediction System (Machine Learning)

##  Project Overview

The Credit Risk Prediction System is a Machine Learning project that predicts whether a loan applicant is a high-risk or low-risk customer based on financial and personal data.
This project helps financial institutions make better loan approval decisions using data-driven insights.
